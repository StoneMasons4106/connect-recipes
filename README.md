# Connect Recipes

We all know how important food is to all of us. It creates memories with friends and family that will last lifetimes.

For this reason, we felt it important to dedicate this project to the thing we all love... food! We want people to be able to share their recipes with others to connect people across the world, instead of divide, which we've seen a lot of lately.

You'll be able to share your recipes, and save others so you can try them yourself later. What's best, it doesn't cost you a dime to use!
